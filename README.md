# Ebay_Perfume_Sales_Analysis
### Project Overview 
The purpose of this project was to clean and analyze a dataset of eBay perfume sales. Using SQL server, I performed data cleaning to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the dataset. The cleaned data was then imported into Power BI for visualization and further analysis. The analysis revealed several key insights such as: 
  - Total sales performance 
  - Top-selling women's and men's brand
  - Most popular fragrance types
  - Geographic insights
